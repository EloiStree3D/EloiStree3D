My name is Ã‰loi StrÃ©e.  

  
I am mainly of developer Unity3D with a "hobbyjob" in new-tech and virutal reality.

But my second hobby due to my lifetime project, OMI, is 3D printer (PLA & CNC).     

 
As I don't want to mix my code and my 3D projects, I created this secondary account.  
Enjoy my 3D models and workshop on the topic.

May the code be with you.
